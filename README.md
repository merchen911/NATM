# Neural additive time-series models: Explainable deep learning for multivariate time-series prediction (NATMs)


This repo is the Pytorch implementation of [NATMs](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.120307).

## How to use?

We provide the jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) for learning and inference process.</br>
Also, python script registered but we recommend to use the notebook.</br>
